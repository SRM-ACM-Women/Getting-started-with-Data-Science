# Getting-started-with-Data-Science
Data Science is said to be the sexiest job of 21st century.
So here is an, introduction to important python libraries which you need to get started with Data Science.
In this repository, you can find jupyter notebooks explaining the basics of Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and a simple data science project for you to see a glimpse of what you can achieve with these tools.
## pandas

pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

## Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

## Seaborn
